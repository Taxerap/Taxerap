## Introduction

No matter who you are, allow me to sincerely thank you for coming to this meaningless trash page.

I'm Taxerap, someone that's... someone.

## Finished works

**[Finc](https://github.com/Taxerap/NameGen)**  
A small utility program, finding all the _*.c_ files under ./src folder for me to copy-paste into shell script to compile C programs.  
Yes, I know Make.  
No, I won't use it.  
No, nor CMake.

**[NameGen](https://github.com/Taxerap/NameGen)**  
A program that generates nicknames by the consonant-vowel-consonant... format. It generates a surprising amount of Japanese names...  
This is probably the first ever _thing_ that I completed on a computer. I got it done back in middle school, when I was playing with Java because I wanted to make Minecraft mods.

## Main repositories

**[sowr](https://github.com/State-of-War-PostBar/sowr)**

## Other documents

Contents here may be English, may be Chinese. I don't have the intent of writing two versions since no one's gonna read them. I'll just use whatever language that's easiest for me to write, for that time being.
