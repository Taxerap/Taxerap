I'm Taxerap, someone that's... someone.  
Yeah right, you are looking at the profile of someone that dropped out from a four-year university...

## Actually finished works (extraordinary rare for me)

**[NameGen](https://github.com/Taxerap/NameGen)**  
A program that generates nicknames by a consonant-vowel-consonant... format. It generates a surprising amount of Japanese names...  
This is probably the first ever _thing_ that I completed on a computer. I got it done back in middle school, when I was playing with Java because I wanted to make Minecraft mods.

**[Finc](https://github.com/Taxerap/Finc)**  
A small utility program, finding all the _.c_ files under ./src folder for me to copy-paste into shell script for compiling C programs.

**[Tilmi](https://github.com/State-of-War-PostBar/Tilmi)**  
A tool for making til and tmi resources for the game _State of War_.

## Main repositories

**[Blue Alert](https://github.com/State-of-War-PostBar/Blue-Alert)**  
_[sound of a pigeon flying away]_

**[erap](https://github.com/Taxerap/erap)**  
_[sound of another pigeon flying away]_

## Other documents

Contents here may be English, may be Chinese. I don't have the intention of writing two versions since no one's gonna read them. I'll just use whatever language that's easiest for me to write for that time being.
